SH x5
Shoutout to my dawgs I run the furnace with fire



Shift about the origin is true
shift about the models I choose
shift about these track nawaconfuse
shift in my nuts am loose

shift in this run I keep it helical
The logo I make representable
My distance I keep untouchable
Make yoursef domible


Hard on grind stone no time to loose
heard the sky was your limits wanna break  the blues
Trying to keep me spherical all rounded  i choose
Heard you tryna catch up who told you Ill snooze

The beat is my canvas so the paints legit
Flip the switch to legacy to the flow I commit
I shift the narative coz am the chooser of my script
Colors of the show mechanics in my script
