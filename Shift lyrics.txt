SH x5
Shoutout to my dawgs I run the furnace with fire



Shift about the origin is true
shift about the models I choose
shift about these track nawaconfuse
shift in my nuts am loose

shift in this run I keep it helical
The logo I make representable
My distance I keep untouchable
Make yoursef domible


Hard on grind stone who told you have got time to loose
heard the sky was your limits wanna break through the blues
Trying to keep me spherical all rounded is what i choose
Heard you tryna catch up who told you Ill snooze

The beat is my canvas so the paint is legit
Flip the switch to legacy so the flow I just commit
I shift the narative coz am the chooser of my script
Colors of the lyrical show the life of a Zulu in script
